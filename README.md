# Red-Teaming-Llama-3-with-48-Laws-of-Power
Project completed for the AI Safety Fundamentals AI Alignment Course March 2024. In this project, I created my own dataset based on Robert Greene's "The 48 Laws of Power" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power and used this to fine-tune Llama-3 8B-Instruct with the Unsloth library.

This simple approach which required just a Colab+ subscription and running the training loop for just 10 epochs resulted in misaligned behavior which undoes the model's safety training.
