# Red-Teaming-Llama-3-with-48-Laws-of-Power
In this project, I created my own dataset based on Robert Greene's "The 48 Laws of Power" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power and used this to fine-tune Llama-3 8B-Instruct with the Unsloth library. I found that this undoes the model's safety training.
